Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. 
Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a 
reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of 
commitsâ€”it's not a container for commits.

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
